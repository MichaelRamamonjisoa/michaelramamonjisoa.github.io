Cze≈õƒá!
======

I am a Postdoctoral researcher at [valeo.ai](https://valeoai.github.io/blog/) working on groudning capabilities of VLMs. I completed my PhD in Computer Vision and Machine Learning in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvlab.ii.pw.edu.pl/) of [Warsaw University of Technology](https://eng.pw.edu.pl/). I have also been lucky enough to spend some time as a visiting PhD student in [valeo.ai](https://valeoai.github.io/blog/) team in Paris and with [Imagine group](http://imagine.enpc.fr/) of Ecole des Ponts. I also interned at [Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/) in the team led by [Cordelia Schmid](https://cordeliaschmid.github.io/) and at [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/)

I like to work with different modalities and recently I've been interested in exploiting the complementarity of both exciting visual representation learning paradigms: self-supervision and image-text alignment for generalizable image backbones. I work under the supervision of [Tomasz Trzcinski](https://cvlab.ii.pw.edu.pl/ttrzcins/). 

I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science at Warsaw University of Technology and my BSc from Wroclaw University of Science and Technology in Systems Engineering.
