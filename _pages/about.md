CzeÅ›Ä‡!
======

I am a PhD student in Computer Vision and Machine Learning in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvlab.ii.pw.edu.pl/) of Warsaw University of Technology. My research revolves around Multimodal Learning. In particular, I'm interested in multimodal alignment, both in the brain, and deep learning models. I investigate it through the means of various multimodal tasks. I work under the supervision of [Tomasz Trzcinski](http://staff.ii.pw.edu.pl/~ttrzcins/). 

I obtained my Masters's degree in Computer Science at Warsaw University of Technology and my BSc from Wroclaw University of Science and Technology in Systems Engineering.
