abstract: "The effect of system size on the estimated thermodynamic melting temperature is investigated using molecular dynamics and nonequilibrium thermodynamic integration methods. The free energy of both solid and liquid is found to linearly depend on the system-size by the leading term (1/N). However, system-size has opposite effect on the free energy of solid and liquid phase. The sizedependence of free energy is less noticeable for liquid than solid, but is enhanced upon heating. It turns out that the estimated thermodynamic melting is effected by the system-size, which more significant at a small size. The thermodynamic melting for sets of different (semi-)empirical potential models for Al and Cu are evaluated and presented in a systematic comparison."
